MongoDB install

used homebrew
made /data/db 

permissions wrong. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7948789/mongodb-mongod-complains-that-there-is-no-data-db-folder

Absolom:/ scrich$ id -u
501
Absolom:/ scrich$ sudo chown -R `id -u` /data/db
Password:
Absolom:/ scrich$ ls -ld /data/db
drwxr-xr-x  2 scrich  wheel  68 17 Mar 18:42 /data/db

This is not the recommended way to set positions, but the mongod user did not exist.


start up mongo:
If you have installed mongodb through homebrew then you can simply start mongodb through

brew services start mongodb
Then access the shell by

mongo
You can shut down your db by

brew services stop mongodb
For more options
